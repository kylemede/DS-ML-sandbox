DS-ML-sandbox
=============
A sandbox for practicing some data science and machine learning techniques.

This repository is still very much in the works, as I am just starting to build some basic tools to work through some of the data science techniques I have learned thus far.  The vast majority of my tools and repos are on the 'private' side of my git.



Concepts being investigated/learned
===================================   
   
## Overviewed theoretically:
Data Science and Machine Learning:
- Regression Analysis
    - Linear Regression 
    - Multivariate Regression
- K-means Clustering
- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- Train/test and Cross Validation
- Bayesian Methods
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Multi-level models
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Reinforcement Learning:
    -Q-learning
- Collaborative Filtering
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Bias/Variance tradeoff
- Ensemble learning (bootstrap aggregating/bagging)
- Term Frequency/ Inverse Document Frequency
- Experimental design and A/B tests
- Breadth-first-search

Big Data:
- Spark in Python
    - Before Spark 2.0 ->Resilient Distributed Datastores
    - Spark 2.0 and up -> DataFrames
    - MLlib
    - Brief reviews of Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, and GraphX.
- Elastic MapReduce + Hadoop YARN to distribute Spark jobs


Overtime I will produce notebooks to discuss some aspects learned about these topics, and experiment with them through code.  See those notebooks started so far below.
